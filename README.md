### Cloning Down the Repo
Use any Java IDE, we suggest using IntelliJ:

  - Download [IntelliJ](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/) Community Edition

  - Using the Import option, select the pom.xml file.

  - IntelliJ will automatically build the dependencies using Maven (built into IntelliJ).

  - Then, open [MySQL workbench](https://www.mysql.com/products/workbench/) and run the queries included in the `database` folder.
  
  - Please note that the `ApplicationDAO` class will need to have its username & password updated to match your environment.

  - After that, click the green play button in IntelliJ to run the project.

  - Finally, open up to [localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080/) in your browser to see the webapp in action.
